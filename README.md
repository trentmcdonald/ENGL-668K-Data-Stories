# ENGL-668K-Data-Stories

Materials for the Data Stories module in Introduction to Digital Studies at 
the University of Maryland (Fall 2015).

**Due: Thursday, December 10 at 5pm.**

Your final exercise for the course is to use Google Sheets with the TAGS 
plug-in to collect data from Twitter and tell a short "data story" about 
the data you have collected. You will be working with a partner from a 
single shared data set; however, you will EACH BE SUBMITTING YOUR OWN 
INDIVIDUAL DATA STORY.

1. With your partner, decide on a data set to collect. You might choose a 
particular individual or Twitter account, or a hashtag, or phrase or term. 
Regardless, put some thought into what you want to collect, and if the 
data doesn't seem sufficiently "interesting" don't hesitate to try 
something else instead. In many ways, the decision of *what* to collect 
is the most important part of the assignment.

2. Explore the data using whatever spreadsheet functions you wish as 
well as the TAGS Explorer tool. What does the data seem to show? 
What are some possible explanations for what you see? Just as 
importantly, what *isn't* ascertainable from the data? Each member of the 
team should write their own data story, between 500-1000 words in length. 
Don't try to summarize *all* of the data. Just pick one thread and follow 
it through, telling us what might account for the conclusions you wish to 
draw and what the limits of those insights are. You may reference 
Pasquale or other readings if it seems helpful, but your focus should 
be on your data set, not responding to the readings.

3. Finally--and critically--please have whichever partner is running 
TAGS Share your spreadsheet with both Ed and me at these addresses: 
ehs@pobox.com, mkirschenbaum@gmail.com Writing your data story here 
(each of you) and sharing the sheet via Google completes the Exercise.

To create your file first fork the repository, and then use the `New File` button near the top of the screen to create a new file using your name as the filename: e.g. `matt_kirschenbaum.md`. Then edit the file as needed and when you are done try to send a pull request. You may notice that the format of the page is [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Feel free to use markdown in your data story if you want.
