Engl 668k Data Adventure

The data adventure began before it even started. 

I needed to work with my teammate, Chen, to find a line of inquiry that seemed fruitful for data mining. Some points to consider were: 
1)	The recentness of the data (it has to fit the timeframe provided by TAGS)
2)	The amount of data available (more data = more to work with)
3)	The importance of the data (it can’t be completely trivial)

With this in mind, I periodically checked Twitter to see what was trending. I noticed that former U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger died. I knew nothing about him and neither did Chen, but a little cursory work revealed that he was a controversial figure for stealing some classified government documents. This seemed like it could be an interesting data adventure. However, we did not pursue this line of inquiry any further because we were both disinterested in the topic. 

With Chen suggesting that we look into some data within the field of pop-culture (which was more interesting to us), I noticed that Scott Weiland, the singer for Stone Temple Pilots (one of my favorite bands) and Velvet Revolver, had died. I took a snapshot of the data, seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bq1vsotbjCLwsHX0TEIH5fS-_oV0j_QRD0abHiSkvQ0/edit?usp=sharing Chen agreed that this topic was good enough to pursue, and so began the data adventure!

The data adventure begins, but where to begin?

What first interested me about this data set was the shift in subject matter. A very cursory analysis of the data reveals that prior to Fri Dec 04 04:49:37 all of the tweets about Weiland discussed either 1) his upcoming concert, or 2) a retweet of his quote “Fuck ISIS.” This period represents the social network as it existed before the news of Weiland’s death. 

The tweet by LongPaulLA at 4:49pm is the first mention of Scott Weiland’s death, citing an article by KNAC.com reporting the news. Apparently news outlets reported on the death of Weiland before people on Twitter knew about it. After this time, nearly all of the tweets about Weiland are about his death, with a few tweets still advertising his upcoming concert (which I assume is canceled now). Interestingly, LongPaulLA is not a very popular user (only 213 followers), but he is the co-founder of the website KNAC.com, which appears to have broken the news. LongPaulLA’s following only increased by 6 after the story broke, so I guess this story did not do much to increase his reputation. Instead, after LongPaulLA broke the news, TMZ became the more popularly cited source of reference, cited 84 times to LongPaulLA’s 10. I found this information using the TAGS Explorer function. 

The most active tweeter during this period was user Ufcvancouverbc, who goes by the name Trevor. Trevor does not appear to be a particularly noteworthy person, just someone who took the news of Weiland’s death especially hard for some reason. He made nine re-tweets after Weiland died. Users TheJays and M11KE_MC11 were close behind Trevor with eight tweets. M11KE is noteworthy for being a Spanish-speaking tweeter from Bogota, Colombia. He has 1442 followers, which makes him a slightly larger node on the map and the most active tweeter of the Spanish-speaking users. I also found this information using the TAGS explorer function.

The authors with the greatest following to spread the news of Weiland’s death were @Pitchfork (a website covering music news) with 2.96M followers; @JoeRogan with 1.74M followers; and @THR (a Hollywood media news outlet) with 1.72M. After these three there is somewhat of a steep decline in posters with a large following. I was able to find this information by organizing a pivot table, organizing the authors by their number of followers. 

One noteworthy author with a moderately-large following (285k) and a highly retweeted post was Dave Navarro, host of the television show “Inkmaster,” and guitarist for Jane’s Addiction and (briefly) the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His tweet was retweeted 2380 times. Navarro was probably a friend of Weiland’s, being one of his contemporaries in the 90s rock scene. 

As expected, the top hashtag associated with the news was #rip, cited a total of 428 times in this dataset. #ripScottWeiland was the next most used hashtag at 208. #stp was the third most used hashtag at 149 times. 

My final line of inquiry was invoked by a troll post: “That junkie Scott Weiland finally OD for the last time. Congrats on finally kicking the habit.” The author, harrynutzac1, is one of your typical internet trolls, advertising himself as “Anti-Feminist, Anti-Censorship, Pro-Non Violent Rape.” His profile could be the centerpiece for an essay on trolling, since he seems to offend in every way imaginable: pro-Nazi, pro-KKK, pro-chauvinism, anti-Muslim, anti-gay, and the list goes on (I don’t feel like reading it all). His latest escapades seemed to involve angrily trolling the #EndViolenceAgainstWomen hashtag, which elicited a number of angry responses. His personal website, www.ChurchOfElDuce.com, leads to a crude and creepy webpage promoting what I assume is a heavy metal band. The author seems to go by the stage name “Dr. Heathen Scum,” although it appears his actual name is Steve Broy. His band seems to be KKK-themed. The bottom of the page shows what appears to be a photo of a dead prostitute, which I hope is not real. Being a rock musician himself, I assume he was aware of Scott Weiland, though I guess he did not respect him as a person… or maybe he’s just trolling, who knows. 

Sometimes I forget the internet can be a frightening place inhabited by loathsome people. I wish my data adventure had not ended here.
